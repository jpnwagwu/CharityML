# CharityML

In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) 
identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause. Finding potential donors for a charity involves analyzing data about the US population 
and grouping that population by similar interests/traits that can help identify likely donors.
